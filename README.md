# Single_Molecule_Detection
Code used for data analysis of videos of fluorescent single molecules. This includes code used to generate simulated videos to test accuracy of detection as well as all data used to generate simulated videos.

A sample video is included for the example files. To run the example yourself, place the EGFP_July14 folder in the Mathematica notebook directory or change the folderPath to the correct path for you.
